# Blue: a Style Guide for Julia

[![Code Style: Blue](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-blue-4495d1.svg)](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle)

This document specifies style conventions for Julia code.
These conventions were created from a variety of sources including Python's [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), Julia's [Notes for Contributors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and Julia's [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/style-guide/).

## A Word on Consistency

When adhering to this style it's important to realize that these are guidelines and not rules.
This is [stated best in the PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds):

> A style guide is about consistency.
> Consistency with this style guide is important.
> Consistency within a project is more important.
> Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

> But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style guide just doesn't apply.
> When in doubt, use your best judgment.
> Look at other examples and decide what looks best.
> And don't hesitate to ask!

## Synopsis

Attempt to follow both the [Julia Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#general-formatting-guidelines-for-julia-code-contributions), the [Julia Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/style-guide/), and this guide.
When convention guidelines conflict this guide takes precedence (known conflicts will be noted in this guide).

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.
- Try to adhere to a 92 character line length limit.
- Use upper camel-case convention for [modules](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/modules/) and [types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/types/).
- Use lower case with underscores for method names (note: Julia code likes to use lower case without underscores).
- Import modules with `using`, with one module per line and at the top of the file when possible.
- Comments are good, try to explain the intentions of the code.
- Use whitespace to make the code more readable.
- No whitespace at the end of a line (trailing whitespace).
- Avoid padding brackets with spaces. ex. `Int64(value)` preferred over `Int64( value )`.

## Code Formatting

### Module Imports

[Module imports](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/#Summary-of-module-usage-1) should occur at the top of the file or right after a `module` declaration.
Files loaded via an `include` should avoid specifying their own module imports and should instead add them to the file in which they were included (e.g. "src/Example.jl" or "test/runtests.jl").

A module import should only specify a single package per line.
The lines should be ordered alphabetically by the package/module name (note: relative imports precede absolute imports).

```julia
# Yes:
using A
using B

# No:
using A, B

# No:
using B
using A
```

Imports which explicitly declare what to bring into scope should be grouped into: constants, types, macros, and functions.
These groupings should be specified in that order and each group's contents should be sorted alphabetically.
As pseudo-code:

```julia
using Example: $(sort(constants)...), $(sort(types)...), $(sort(macros)...), $(sort(functions)...)
```

In some scenarios there may be alternate ordering within a group which makes more logical sense.
For example when explicitly importing subtypes of `Period` you may want to sort them in units largest to smallest:

```julia
using Dates: Year, Month, Week, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Millisecond
```

Explicit import lines which exceed the line length should use line-continuation or multiple import statements for the same package.
Using multiple import statements should be preferred when creating alternate groupings:

```julia
# Yes:
using AVeryLongPackage: AVeryLongType, AnotherVeryLongType, a_very_long_function,
    another_very_long_function

# Yes:
using AVeryLongPackage: AVeryLongType, AnotherVeryLongType
using AVeryLongPackage: a_very_long_function, another_very_long_function

# No:
using AVeryLongPackage:
    AVeryLongType,
    AnotherVeryLongType,
    a_very_long_function,
    another_very_long_function

# No:
using AVeryLongPackage: AVeryLongType
using AVeryLongPackage: AnotherVeryLongType
using AVeryLongPackage: a_very_long_function
using AVeryLongPackage: another_very_long_function
```

Note: Prefer the use of imports with explicit declarations when writing packages.
Doing so will make maintaining the package easier by knowing what functionality the package is importing and when dependencies can safely be dropped.

Prefer the use of `using` over `import` to ensure that extension of a function is always explicit and on purpose:

```julia
# Yes:
using Example

Example.hello(x::Monster) = "Aargh! It's a Monster!"
Base.isreal(x::Ghost) = false

# No:
import Base: isreal
import Example: hello

hello(x::Monster) = "Aargh! It's a Monster!"
isreal(x::Ghost) = false
```

If you do require the use of `import` then create separate groupings for `import` and `using` statements divided by a blank line:

```julia
# Yes:
import A: a
import C

using B
using D: d

# No:
import A: a
using B
import C
using D: d
```

### Global Variables

Global variables should be avoided whenever possible. When required, global variables should be `const`s and have an all uppercase name seperated with underscores (e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`).
They should be defined at the top of the file, immediately after imports and exports but before an `__init__` function.
If you truly want mutable global style behaviour you may want to look into mutable containers or closures.

### Function Naming

Names of functions should describe an action or property irrespective of the type of the argument; the argument's type provides this information instead.
For example, `submit_bid(bid)` should be `submit(bid::Bid)` and `bids_in_batch(batch)` should be `bids(batch::Batch)`.

Names of functions should usually be limited to one or two lowercase words separated by underscores.
If you find it hard to shorten your function names without losing information, you may need to factor more information into the type signature or split the function's responsibilities into two or more functions.
In general, shorter functions with clearly-defined responsibilities are preferred.

**NOTE**: Functions that are only intended for internal use should be marked with a leading underscore (e.g., `_internal_utility_function(X, y)`).
Although it should be much less common, the same naming convention can be used for internal types and constants as well (e.g., `_MyInternalType`, `_MY_CONSTANT`).
Marking function as internal or private lets other people know that they shouldn't expected any kind of API stability from that functionality.

### Method Definitions

Only use short-form function definitions when they fit on a single line:

```julia
# Yes:
foo(x::Int64) = abs(x) + 3

# No:
foobar(array_data::AbstractArray{T}, item::T) where {T<:Int64} = T[
    abs(x) * abs(item) + 3 for x in array_data
]
```
```julia
# Yes:
function foobar(array_data::AbstractArray{T}, item::T) where T<:Int64
    return T[abs(x) * abs(item) + 3 for x in array_data]
end

# No:
foobar(
    array_data::AbstractArray{T},
    item::T,
) where {T<:Int64} = T[abs(x) * abs(item) + 3 for x in array_data]
```

When using long-form functions [always use the `return` keyword](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/4RVR8qQDrUg):

```julia
# Yes:
function fnc(x::T) where T
    result = zero(T)
    result += fna(x)
    return result
end

# No:
function fnc(x::T) where T
    result = zero(T)
    result += fna(x)
end
```
```julia
# Yes:
function Foo(x, y)
    return new(x, y)
end

# No:
function Foo(x, y)
    new(x, y)
end
```

Functions definitions with parameter lines which exceed 92 characters should separate each parameter by a newline and indent by one-level:

```julia
# Yes:
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame,
    id::Symbol,
    variable::Symbol,
    value::AbstractString,
    prefix::AbstractString="",
)
    # code
end

# Ok:
function foobar(df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString="")
    # code
end

# No: Don't put any args on the same line as the open parenthesis if they won't all fit.
function foobar(df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString,
    prefix::AbstractString="")

    # code
end

# No: All args should be on a new line in this case.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString,
    prefix::AbstractString=""
)
    # code
end

# No: Indented too much.
function foobar(
        df::DataFrame,
        id::Symbol,
        variable::Symbol,
        value::AbstractString,
        prefix::AbstractString="",
    )
    # code
end
```

If all of the arguments fit inside the 92 character limit then you can place them on 1 line.
Similarly, you can follow the same rule if you break up positional and keyword arguments
across two lines.

```julia
# Ok:
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString; prefix::String=""
)
    # code
end

# Ok: Putting all args and all kwargs on separate lines is fine.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString;
    prefix::String=""
)
    # code
end

# Ok: Putting all positional args on 1 line and each kwarg on separate lines.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString;
    prefix="I'm a long default setting that probably shouldn't exist",
    msg="I'm another long default settings that probably shouldn't exist",
)
    # code
end

# No: Because the separate line is more than 92 characters.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString; prefix::AbstractString=""
)
    # code
end

# No: The args and kwargs should be split up.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol,
    value::AbstractString; prefix::AbstractString=""
)
    # code
end

# No: The kwargs are more than 92 characters.
function foobar(
    df::DataFrame, id::Symbol, variable::Symbol, value::AbstractString;
    prefix="I'm a long default setting that probably shouldn't exist", msg="I'm another long default settings that probably shouldn't exist",
)
    # code
end
```
### Keyword Arguments

When calling a function always separate your keyword arguments from your positional arguments with a semicolon.
This avoids mistakes in ambiguous cases (such as splatting a `Dict`).

```julia
# Yes:
xy = foo(x; y=3)
ab = foo(; a=1, b=2)

# Ok:
ab = foo(a=1, b=2)

# No:
xy = foo(x, y=3)
```

### Whitespace

- Avoid extraneous whitespace immediately inside parentheses, square brackets or braces.

    ```julia
    Yes: spam(ham[1], [eggs])
    No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], [ eggs ] )
    ```

- Avoid extraneous whitespace immediately before a comma or semicolon:

    ```julia
    Yes: if x == 4 @show(x, y); x, y = y, x end
    No:  if x == 4 @show(x , y) ; x , y = y , x end
    ```

- Avoid whitespace around `:` in ranges. Use brackets to clarify expressions on either side.

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    ham[1:9]
    ham[9:-3:0]
    ham[1:step:end]
    ham[lower:upper-1]
    ham[lower:upper - 1]
    ham[lower:(upper + offset)]
    ham[(lower + offset):(upper + offset)]

    # No:
    ham[1: 9]
    ham[9 : -3: 1]
    ham[lower : upper - 1]
    ham[lower + offset:upper + offset]  # Avoid as it is easy to read as `ham[lower + (offset:upper) + offset]`
    ```

- Avoid using more than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with another:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    x = 1
    y = 2
    long_variable = 3

    # No:
    x             = 1
    y             = 2
    long_variable = 3
    ```

- Surround most binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (`=`), [updating operators](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/mathematical-operations/#Updating-operators-1) (`+=`, `-=`, etc.), [numeric comparisons operators](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/mathematical-operations/#Numeric-Comparisons-1) (`==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, etc.), [lambda operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/functions/#man-anonymous-functions-1) (`->`). Binary operators may be excluded from this guideline include: the [range operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/math/#Base.::) (`:`), [rational operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/math/#Base.://) (`//`), [exponentiation operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/math/#Base.:^-Tuple{Number,Number}) (`^`), [optional arguments/keywords](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/functions/#Optional-Arguments-1) (e.g. `f(x=1; y=2)`).

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    i = j + 1
    submitted += 1
    x^2 < y

    # No:
    i=j+1
    submitted +=1
    No:  x^2<y
    ```

- Avoid using whitespace between unary operands and the expression:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    -1
    [1 0 -1]

    # No:
    - 1
    [1 0 - 1]  # Note: evaluates to `[1 -1]`
    ```

- Avoid extraneous empty lines. Avoid empty lines between single line method definitions
    and otherwise separate functions with one empty line, plus a comment if required:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    # Note: an empty line before the first long-form `domaths` method is optional.
    domaths(x::Number) = x + 5
    domaths(x::Int) = x + 10
    function domaths(x::String)
        return "A string is a one-dimensional extended object postulated in string theory."
    end

    dophilosophy() = "Why?"

    # No:
    domath(x::Number) = x + 5

    domath(x::Int) = x + 10



    function domath(x::String)
        return "A string is a one-dimensional extended object postulated in string theory."
    end


    dophilosophy() = "Why?"
    ```

- Function calls which cannot fit on a single line within the line limit should be broken up such that the lines containing the opening and closing brackets are indented to the same level while the parameters of the function are indented one level further.
  In most cases the arguments and/or keywords should each be placed on separate lines.
  Note that this rule conflicts with the typical Julia convention of indenting the next line to align with the open bracket in which the parameter is contained.
  If working in a package with a different convention follow the convention used in the package over using this guideline.

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    f(a, b)
    constraint = conic_form!(
        SOCElemConstraint(temp2 + temp3, temp2 - temp3, 2 * temp1),
        unique_conic_forms,
    )

    # No:
    # Note: `f` call is short enough to be on a single line
    f(
        a,
        b,
    )
    constraint = conic_form!(SOCElemConstraint(temp2 + temp3,
                                               temp2 - temp3, 2 * temp1),
                             unique_conic_forms)
    ```

- Assignments using expanded notation for arrays or tuples, or function calls should have the first open bracket on the same line assignment operator and the closing bracket should match the indentation level of the assignment.
  Alternatively you can perform assignments on a single line when they are short:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
        3,
    ]
    arr = [
        1, 2, 3,
    ]
    result = Function(
        arg1,
        arg2,
    )
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # No:
    arr =
    [
        1,
        2,
        3,
    ]
    arr =
    [
        1, 2, 3,
    ]
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        ]
    ```

- Nested array or tuples that are in expanded notation should have the opening and closing brackets at the same indentation level:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    x = [
        [
            1, 2, 3,
        ],
        [
            "hello",
            "world",
        ],
        ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ]

    # No:
    y = [
        [
            1, 2, 3,
        ], [
            "hello",
            "world",
        ],
    ]
    z = [[
            1, 2, 3,
        ], [
            "hello",
            "world",
        ],
    ]
    ```

- Always include the trailing comma when working with expanded arrays, tuples or functions notation.
  This allows future edits to easily move elements around or add additional elements.
  The trailing comma should be excluded when the notation is only on a single-line:

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
        3,
    ]
    result = Function(
        arg1,
        arg2,
    )
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # No:
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
        3
    ]
    result = Function(
        arg1,
        arg2
    )
    arr = [1, 2, 3,]
    ```

- Triple-quotes use the indentation of the lowest indented line (excluding the opening triple-quote).
  This means the closing triple-quote should be aligned to least indented line in the string.
  Triple-backticks should also follow this style even though the indentation does not matter for them.

    ```julia
    # Yes:
    str = """
        hello
        world!
        """
    str = """
            hello
        world!
        """
    cmd = ```
        program
            --flag value
            parameter
        ```
    # No:
    str = """
        hello
        world!
    """
    ```

### NamedTuples

The `=` character in `NamedTuple`s should be spaced as in keyword arguments.
No space should be put between the name and its value.
`NamedTuple`s should not be prefixed with `;` at the start.
The empty `NamedTuple` should be written `NamedTuple()` not `(;)`

```julia
# Yes:
xy = (x=1, y=2)
x = (x=1,)  # Trailing comma required for correctness.
x = (; kwargs...)  # Semicolon required to splat correctly.

# No:
xy = (x = 1, y = 2)
xy = (;x=1,y=2)
x = (; x=1)
```

### Numbers

Floating-point numbers should always include a leading and/or trailing zero:

```julia
# Yes:
0.1
2.0
3.0f0

# No:
.1
2.
3.f0
```

### Ternary Operator

Ternary operators (`?:`) should generally only consume a single line.
Do not chain multiple ternary operators.
If chaining many conditions, consider using an `if`-`elseif`-`else` conditional, dispatch, or a dictionary.

```julia
# Yes:
foobar = foo == 2 ? bar : baz

# No:
foobar = foo == 2 ?
    bar :
    baz
foobar = foo == 2 ? bar : foo == 3 ? qux : baz
```

As an alternative, you can use a compound boolean expression:

```julia
# Yes:
foobar = if foo == 2
    bar
else
    baz
end

foobar = if foo == 2
    bar
elseif foo == 3
    qux
else
    baz
end
```

### Type annotation

Annotations for function definitions should be as general as possible.

```julia
# Yes:
splicer(arr::AbstractArray, step::Integer) = arr[1:step:end]

# No:
splicer(arr::Array{Int}, step::Int) = arr[1:step:end]
```

Using as generic types as possible allows for a variety of inputs and allows you code to be more general:

```julia
julia> splicer(1:10, 2)
1:2:9

julia> splicer([3.0,5,7,9], 2)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 3.0
 7.0
```

Annotations on type fields need to be given a little more thought.
Using specific concrete types for fields allows Julia to optimize the memory layout but can reduce flexibility.
For example lets take a look at the type `MySubString` which allows us to work with a
subsection of a string without having to copy the data:

```julia
mutable struct MySubString <: AbstractString
    string::AbstractString
    offset::Integer
    endof::Integer
end
```

We want the type to be able to hold any subtype of `AbstractString` but do we need to have `offset` and `endof` to be able to hold any subtype of `Integer`?
Really, no, we should be ok to use `Int` here (`Int64` on 64-bit systems and `Int32` on 32-bit systems).
Note that even though we're using `Int` a user can still do things like `MySubString("foobar", 0x4, 0x6);` as provided `offset` and `endof` values will be converted to an `Int`.

```julia
mutable struct MySubString <: AbstractString
    string::AbstractString
    offset::Int
    endof::Int
end
```

If we truly care about performance there is one more thing we can do by making our type parametric.
The current definition of `MySubString` allows us to modify the `string` field at any time with any subtype of `AbstractString`.
Using a parametric type allows to use any subtype of `AbstractString` upon construction but the field type will be set to something concrete (like `String`) and cannot be changed for the lifetime of the instance.

```julia
mutable struct MySubString{T<:AbstractString} <: AbstractString
    string::T
    offset::Integer
    endof::Integer
end
```

Overall, it is best to keep the types general to start with and later optimize the using parametric types.
Optimizing too early in the code design process can impact your ability to refactor the code early on.

### Package version specifications

For simplicity and consistency with the wider Julia community, avoid including the default caret specifier when specifying package version requirements.

```julia
# Yes:
DataFrames = "0.17"

# No:
DataFrames = "^0.17"
```

### Comments

Comments should be used to state the intended behaviour of code.
This is especially important when the code is doing something clever that may not be obvious upon first inspection.
Avoid writing comments that state exactly what the code obviously does.

```julia
# Yes:
x = x + 1      # Compensate for border

# No:
x = x + 1      # Increment x
```

Comments that contradict the code are much worse than no comments.
Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date with code changes!

Comments should be complete sentences.
If a comment is a phrase or sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).

If a comment is short, the period at the end can be omitted.
Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, and each sentence should end in a period.

Comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the expression and have a single space after the `#`.

When referencing Julia in documentation note that "Julia" refers to the programming language while "julia" (typically in backticks, e.g. `julia`) refers to the executable.

Only use inline comments if they fit within the line length limit. If your comment cannot be fitted inline then place the comment above the content to which it refers:

```julia
# Yes:

# Number of nodes to predict. Again, an issue with the workflow order. Should be updated
# after data is fetched.
p = 1

# No:

p = 1  # Number of nodes to predict. Again, an issue with the workflow order. Should be
# updated after data is fetched.
```

### Documentation

It is recommended that most modules, types and functions should have [docstrings](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/documentation/).
That being said, only exported functions are required to be documented.
Avoid documenting methods like `==` as the built in docstring for the function already covers the details well.
Try to document a function and not individual methods where possible as typically all methods will have similar docstrings.
If you are adding a method to a function which was defined in `Base` or another package only add a docstring if the behaviour of your function deviates from the existing docstring.

Docstrings are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and should be concise.
Docstring lines should be wrapped at 92 characters.

```julia
"""
    bar(x[, y])

Compute the Bar index between `x` and `y`. If `y` is missing, compute the Bar index between
all pairs of columns of `x`.
"""
function bar(x, y) ...
```

When types or methods have lots of parameters it may not be feasible to write a concise docstring.
In these cases it is recommended you use the templates below.
Note if a section doesn't apply or is overly verbose (for example "Throws" if your function doesn't throw an exception) it can be excluded.
It is recommended that you have a blank line between the headings and the content when the content is of sufficient length.
Try to be consistent within a docstring whether you use this additional whitespace.
Note that the additional space is only for reading raw markdown and does not effect the rendered version.

Type Template (should be skipped if is redundant with the constructor(s) docstring):

```julia
"""
    MyArray{T,N}

My super awesome array wrapper!

# Fields
- `data::AbstractArray{T,N}`: stores the array being wrapped
- `metadata::Dict`: stores metadata about the array
"""
struct MyArray{T,N} <: AbstractArray{T,N}
    data::AbstractArray{T,N}
    metadata::Dict
end
```

Function Template (only required for exported functions):

```julia
"""
    mysearch(array::MyArray{T}, val::T; verbose=true) where {T} -> Int

Searches the `array` for the `val`. For some reason we don't want to use Julia's
builtin search :)

# Arguments
- `array::MyArray{T}`: the array to search
- `val::T`: the value to search for

# Keywords
- `verbose::Bool=true`: print out progress details

# Returns
- `Int`: the index where `val` is located in the `array`

# Throws
- `NotFoundError`: I guess we could throw an error if `val` isn't found.
"""
function mysearch(array::AbstractArray{T}, val::T) where T
    ...
end
```

If your method contains lots of arguments or keywords you may want to exclude them from the method signature on the first line and instead use `args...` and/or `kwargs...`.

```julia
"""
    Manager(args...; kwargs...) -> Manager

A cluster manager which spawns workers.

# Arguments

- `min_workers::Integer`: The minimum number of workers to spawn or an exception is thrown
- `max_workers::Integer`: The requested number of worker to spawn

# Keywords

- `definition::AbstractString`: Name of the job definition to use. Defaults to the
    definition used within the current instance.
- `name::AbstractString`: ...
- `queue::AbstractString`: ...
"""
function Manager(...)
    ...
end
```

Feel free to document multiple methods for a function within the same docstring.
Be careful to only do this for functions you have defined.

```julia
"""
    Manager(max_workers; kwargs...)
    Manager(min_workers:max_workers; kwargs...)
    Manager(min_workers, max_workers; kwargs...)

A cluster manager which spawns workers.

# Arguments

- `min_workers::Int`: The minimum number of workers to spawn or an exception is thrown
- `max_workers::Int`: The number of requested workers to spawn

# Keywords

- `definition::AbstractString`: Name of the job definition to use. Defaults to the
    definition used within the current instance.
- `name::AbstractString`: ...
- `queue::AbstractString`: ...
"""
function Manager end

```

If the documentation for bullet-point exceeds 92 characters the line should be wrapped and slightly indented.
Avoid aligning the text to the `:`.

```julia
"""
...

# Keywords
- `definition::AbstractString`: Name of the job definition to use. Defaults to the
    definition used within the current instance.
"""
```

For additional details on documenting in Julia see the [official documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/documentation/).

For documentation written in Markdown files such as `README.md` or `docs/src/index.md` use exactly one sentence per line.

## Test Formatting

### Testsets

Julia provides [test sets](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/Test/#Working-with-Test-Sets-1) which allows developers to group tests into logical groupings.
Test sets can be nested and ideally packages should only have a single "root" test set.
It is recommended that the "runtests.jl" file contains the root test set which contains the remainder of the tests:

```julia
@testset "PkgExtreme" begin
    include("arithmetic.jl")
    include("utils.jl")
end
```

### Comparisons

Most tests are written in the form `@test x == y`.
Since the `==` function doesn't take types into account tests like the following are valid: `@test 1.0 == 1`.
Avoid adding visual noise into test comparisons:

```julia
# Yes:
@test value == 0

# No:
@test value == 0.0
```

## Performance and Optimization

Several of these tips are contained within Julia's [Performance Tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips/).

Much of Julia's performance gains come from being able to specialize functions on their input types.
Putting variables and functionality in the global namespace or module's namespace thwarts this.
One consequence of this is that conventional MATLAB-style scripts will result in surprisingly slow code.
There are two ways to mitigate this:

- Move as much functionality into functions as possible.
- Declare global variables as constants using `const`.

Remember that the first time you call a function with a certain type signature it will compile that function for the given input types.
Compilation is sometimes a significant portion of time, so avoid profiling/timing functions on their first run. Note that the `@benchmark` and `@btime` macros from the [BenchmarkTools](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) package can be useful as they run the function many times and report summary statistics of time and memory allocation, alleviating the need to run the function first before benchmarking.

## Editor Configuration

### Sublime Text Settings

If you are a user of Sublime Text we recommend that you have the following options in your Julia syntax specific settings.
To modify these settings first open any Julia file (`*.jl`) in Sublime Text.
Then navigate to: `Preferences > Settings - More > Syntax Specific - User`

```json
{
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
    "tab_size": 4,
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
    "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
    "rulers": [92]
}
```

### Vim Settings

If you are a user of Vim we recommend that you add to your `.vim/vimrc` file:

```
" ~/.vim/vimrc
set tabstop=4       " Set tabstops to a width of four columns.
set softtabstop=4   " Determine the behaviour of TAB and BACKSPACE keys with expandtab.
set shiftwidth=4    " Determine the results of >>, <<, and ==.

" Identify .jl files as Julia. If using julia-vim plugin, this is redundant.
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.jl set filetype=julia
```

Then create or edit `.vim/after/ftplugin/julia.vim`, adding the Julia-specifc configuration:

```
" ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/julia.vim
setlocal expandtab       " Replace tabs with spaces.
setlocal textwidth=92    " Limit lines according to Julia's CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
setlocal colorcolumn+=1  " Highlight first column beyond the line limit.
```

Additionally, you may find is useful to use the
[julia-vim plugin](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim)
which adds Julia-aware syntax highlighting and a few cool other features.

### Atom Settings

Atom defaults preferred line length to 80 characters. We want that at 92 for julia.
To change it:

1. Go to `Atom -> Preferences -> Packages`.
2. Search for the "language-julia" package and open the settings for it.
3. Find preferred line length (under "Julia Grammar") and change it to 92.


### VS-Code Settings

If you are a user of VS Code we recommend that you have the following options in your Julia syntax specific settings.
To modify these settings open your VS Code Settings with <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> (Mac OS) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> (other OS), and add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "[julia]": {
        "editor.detectIndentation": false,
        "editor.insertSpaces": true,
        "editor.tabSize": 4,
        "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
        "files.trimFinalNewlines": true,
        "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
        "editor.rulers": [92],
    },
}
```
Additionally you may find the [Julia VS-Code plugin](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode) useful.
